# FPG Website

This is the official website for **FPG**, my Heavy-Metal-Punk band. It was created as part of an advanced website assignment for Mult128 and features a fully responsive design with a custom neon theme. The site includes five main pages: Home, About, Music, Gallery, and Contact.

The website uses **HTML5, SCSS, and Bootstrap 5** for styling and layout. Interactive elements include clickable social media links (Instagram, Spotify, YouTube) and music links (Bandcamp & Spotify). Images, music cards, and hover effects give the site a dynamic, immersive feel.
